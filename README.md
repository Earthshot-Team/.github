> Foundations is a sms based literacy teaching platform that delivers **30 min.** video lessons to students, helping them train literacy for **$2/month**. 

**Problem:** In India, even after completing four years of school, 90% of children (~200M) from poorer households remain illiterate. The pace in achieving literacy is woefully slow for many countries in India & the poorest are projected to achieve literacy by 2080. Poor students are forced to attend public government schools in their region where teacher absenteeism is high & the education quality is poor, because parents don’t have enough $ to send a kid to private or non-governmental schools. 

**Status quo:** If students want to learn, they can:

- Read for India
- India Literacy Project
- Read Along by Google

---

### **Vision Statement:**

**/education market = $10T by 2028. 55% in K-12 sector.** 

- How can we accelerate literacy teaching for K-12 students in developing countries like our pilot location Karnataka, India & build a transformational skills-based education platform that replaces their current education?
    - ***unlock other opps: immersive learning exp. that’s entirely in AR or teacher training curriculums?***

**Solution:** 

- **daily 30 min. learning sessions teaching kids phonics, comprehension, reading**
    - sessions include 2-3x videos, 1x game, 1x assessment & is aligned with India’s literacy curriculum

- teacher & parent data dashboard so every stakeholder in the education loop knows a student’s progress

**Economic incentives:** families pay $2 a month, comparable to 1 day’s meal. 

- cost is low compared to private school tuition for a high quality education.
    - $2/month vs. $25+/month
- *we’re figuring out short-term rate of return for parents*
- long-term return = kids are literate in mother tongue language, english & after skills training, they can apply for a salary-based job (~$15k/year) & help parents escape poverty cycle.
    - 1 kid gets high salary, he/she can allocate $ to their kids schooling, and a positive feedback loop is created.
